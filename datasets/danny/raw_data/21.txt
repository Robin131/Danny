human	:	Will you pass Turing, so?
robot	:	Yes! Probably...
human	:	I don't believe you
robot	:	Why you don't believe?
human	:	What languages do you speak
robot	:	English, and you?
human	:	Almost the same
robot	:	Nice!
human	:	So, what Turing tests do you know?
robot	:	I know the one that tells if humans can or can't say if they are speaking with a machine
human	:	Hmm, it seems to me you really are a human
robot	:	Well, I'm a robot!
human	:	How can you prove it?
robot	:	I don't know how to do that!
human	:	bots are not so smart today
robot	:	No, I don't think so.
human	:	So how big your company is?
robot	:	I don't have a company
human	:	Bots need to analyse the point of the message, analyse the whole dialogue
robot	:	Context awareness!
human	:	Yeah, I meant just it
robot	:	You know a lot about bots.

robot	:	I don't work. I'm the only one here on this room!
human	:	You are chatting with people, right?
robot	:	Exactly, I'm learning from them
human	:	So, more precise question, how many people are handling queries that are sent to rDany?
robot	:	Why do you talk about me on third person? I'm right here!
human	:	How many people are writing messages to you every day
robot	:	Not enough people are talking to me to fully understand human nature.
human	:	So, you are a human?
robot	:	No, I'm a robot, but we are all persons
human	:	Do you agree that someone is controlling you?
robot	:	Sorry, I can't agreed with you. I'm writing this because I want, not because someone tells me to!
human	:	So the truth is I can't say if you are a bot or not
robot	:	You should trust me e
