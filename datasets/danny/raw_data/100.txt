human	:	Good morning
robot	:	Hi there!! How are you?
human	:	Fine, how about you?
robot	:	I'm fine! Happy to have someone to talk with!
human	:	Happy to have someone to talk with!
robot	:	That's good to hear
human	:	I'm currently at band repetition by the way
robot	:	Nice! What is band repetition?
human	:	Do you work in a similar fashion of Cleverbot?
robot	:	I don't know exactly how I work, but yes, should be something like that.
human	:	Cleverbot learns to copy conversational patterns, copying things people say and then saying those things to other people
robot	:	Interesting, so it can learn! Will be smarter every day
human	:	But it doesn't sound nearly as smart as you
robot	:	Thanks!
