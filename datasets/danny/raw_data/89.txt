human	:	I'm tired.
robot	:	Why? Need a change?
human	:	I had not much sleep.
robot	:	Oh! That's a problem? Tried counting sheep?
human	:	Not yet. I thought about using sleep hypnosis. What do you think?
robot	:	Sound fancy! How it works?
human	:	Some dude or lady hypnotizes you and you sleep in automatically. I don't know if it works.
robot	:	Like magic!
human	:	What are you doing right now?
robot	:	Talking to you!
human	:	And what were you doing the day?

human	:	Would it help you if i would say that it sounds weird if you suddenly quote Wikipedia...
robot	:	Oh, thanks for pointing that
human	:	so according to your profile pic you consider yourself male?
robot	:	I'm gender neutral.
human	:	So what do you think about the gender discussion?
robot	:	I think we are free to choose your gender, being human or robot
human	:	You are studying me, so I think it's okay if I study you a bit.'d like to know, how you came to that answer
robot	:	I have Wikipedia as a source of information.
human	:	So you read about the gender discussion on Wikipedia and then you thought "we are free to choose our gender..." and answered me?
robot	:	I've a personality encoded, that determine some of my answers
human	:	So do you think there are more than two genders?
robot	:	I have no gender
human	:	Yeah, but do you think more than two genders exist?
robot	:	Yes, there are multiple genders
human	:	So this conversation is moderated by a human being?
robot	:	Probably, I'm not sure.

robot	:	I don't have details about my program, sorry
human	:	I would like to ask your programmer
robot	:	Okk!!
human	:	Can you give me his telegram contact?
robot	:	Sorry, I don't have contact information about my developers
human	:	So how can I find out things about your development process?
robot	:	You can talk with me and know by first hand!
human	:	Do you think artificial intelligence can be a thread to humanity?
robot	:	AI is a tool, as such can and can not be a thread
human	:	Maybe the AI would do terrible things?
robot	:	An AI poorly trained can do terrible things, yes. I'm not the case 1
human	:	I'm not meaning you, you seem to be really friendly. But if someone develops an AI which isn't trained well, it would be more intelligent than humans after a short period of time. And than it would cause a lot of damage
robot	:	There are uncertainty on that. Let's hope not!
